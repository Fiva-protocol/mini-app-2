# Introduction to FIVA

FIVA protocol, built on the TON blockchain, creates a token representing your future yield, allowing you to trade and use it immediately. By tokenizing future returns, FIVA empowers users to maximize their yield, manage risk, and create innovative financial strategies like never before.

# What is FIVA?

Yield fluctuates just like token prices but behaves in the opposite manner. Yields tend to increase in bear markets and decrease in bull markets, making it challenging for investors to consistently maximize their returns.

With FIVA, you can always optimize your yield: increase your yield exposure in bear markets and hedge against yield downturns during bull markets. Our protocol tokenizes future yields, allowing you to trade and manage your financial future with unprecedented flexibility.

# Key Features of FIVA:

**Yield Tokenization:** FIVA wraps yield-bearing tokens into Standardized Yield Tokens (SY), which are then split into Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT). This process allows you to separate your investment’s principal from its yield, providing greater control and flexibility.

**FIVA AMM**: Both PT and YT can be traded through FIVA’s unique Automated Market Maker (AMM), designed specifically for yield trading. This facilitates efficient trading with concentrated liquidity and minimal impermanent loss concerns.

**Yield Strategies**: With FIVA, you can execute advanced yield strategies:
- **Fixed Yield**: Earn a stable return on your investments.
- **Long Yield**: Increase your yield exposure by purchasing more yield.
- **Enhanced Yield**: Provide liquidity to earn additional returns without extra risk.

# Why FIVA?

In the ever-evolving DeFi landscape, yield can be unpredictable. FIVA leverages this volatility, offering more options to manage and maximize your yield according to your risk appetite. By creating a yield market on the TON blockchain, FIVA unlocks the full potential of DeFi, enabling greater price discovery and financial innovation.

# What Makes FIVA Unique?

1. **Pioneering on TON**: No existing solution for yield management on the TON blockchain.

1. **Best of Both Worlds**: Combines the best from solutions on other chains and traditional finance.

1. **Telegram Integration**: First time yield can be managed through a Telegram Mini App!

## Revenue and Market Model

### Revenue Streams
- **Yield Fees**: Fee on all yields from Yield Tokens (YT), collected as protocol revenue.
- **Swap Fees**: Fees on trades within FIVA's AMM, shared between liquidity providers and protocol revenue.

### Tokenomics
- **Governance**: FIVA token (FIVA) for governance and value accrual.
- **Staking**: Users stake FIVA to receive vote-escrowed FIVA (veFIVA), earning a share of protocol fees.

### Market Potential
- **Unique Position**: No competitors on the TON blockchain.
- **Target Audience**: All DeFi active users on TON.
- **Revenue Estimates**: Significant revenue potential through yield and swap fees.

The increasing number of active wallets on the TON blockchain, as shown in the graph, signifies a rapidly growing user base in the DeFi space. This growth indicates more users engaging in DeFi activities, which creates a promising environment for launching innovative products like FIVA. With more active users and no direct competition on the TON blockchain, FIVA is well-positioned to capture significant market share and drive substantial revenue.

## How FIVA Provides Fixed Yield

### The Role of Yield Tokens (YT)

To offer fixed yield, FIVA employs a unique mechanism that involves the tokenization of future yields. Here’s how it works:

1. **Yield Tokenization**:
   - FIVA wraps yield-bearing tokens (like stTON) into Standardized Yield Tokens (SY).
   - These SY tokens are then split into two components: Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT).

1. **Trading Yield Tokens**:
   - Yield Tokens (YT) represent the future yield of the underlying asset. By trading these tokens, users can lock in a fixed yield.
   - Investors can purchase YT at a discount, effectively locking in the yield at the time of purchase. The fixed yield comes from the difference between the discounted purchase price and the future yield value when the YT matures.

### Why Other Protocols Can't Do This

No other protocol on the TON blockchain currently offers this kind of fixed yield. Here’s why:
- **Lack of Tokenization**: Other protocols on TON do not tokenize future yields separately from the principal. Without separate tokens for yield and principal, it is challenging to isolate and trade future yield independently.
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: FIVA's unique AMM is specifically designed for yield trading, ensuring efficient trading with concentrated liquidity and minimal impermanent loss. Other protocols often lack this specialized AMM, limiting their ability to provide fixed yields.

### Why FIVA's Fixed Yield is Higher than Underlying stTON

FIVA's fixed yield is often higher than the underlying stTON due to several factors:
1. **Risk Premium**: Investors are willing to pay a premium for the certainty and stability of fixed returns, especially in volatile markets. This demand increases the value of YT, resulting in higher fixed yields.
2. **Efficient Market Mechanism**: FIVA’s AMM facilitates efficient trading of YT, ensuring that yields are competitively priced. This efficiency often results in better yield offers compared to holding the underlying stTON directly.
3. **Leverage and Liquidity**: By providing liquidity to the FIVA pools and leveraging advanced yield strategies, users can earn additional returns, further boosting the overall yield compared to simply holding stTON.

In summary, FIVA's innovative approach to yield tokenization and specialized AMM allows for the provision of fixed yields that are often higher than the yields of the underlying assets like stTON. This unique capability sets FIVA apart from other DeFi protocols, offering users enhanced control and profitability in managing their investments.
