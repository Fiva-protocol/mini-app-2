# FIVA: The Future of Yield Trading on TON

**Unlock the potential of your future gains today!**

## Introduction to FIVA
Unlock the potential of your future gains today with FIVA! Our protocol, built on the TON blockchain, creates a token representing your future yield, allowing you to trade and use it immediately. By tokenizing future returns, FIVA empowers users to maximize their yield, manage risk, and create innovative financial strategies like never before.

## What is FIVA?
FIVA is a cutting-edge, permissionless yield-trading protocol designed to give you full control over your yield. Our protocol enables the trading of tokenized future yield, allowing you to manage your financial future with unprecedented flexibility.

## Key Features of FIVA:
- **Yield Tokenization**: FIVA wraps yield-bearing tokens into Standardized Yield Tokens (SY), which are then split into Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT). This process allows you to separate your investment’s principal from its yield, providing greater control and flexibility.
- **FIVA AMM**: Both PT and YT can be traded through FIVA’s unique Automated Market Maker (AMM), designed specifically for yield trading. This facilitates efficient trading with concentrated liquidity and minimal impermanent loss concerns.
- **Yield Strategies**: With FIVA, you can execute advanced yield strategies:
  - **Fixed Yield**: Earn a stable return on your investments.
  - **Long Yield**: Increase your yield exposure by purchasing more yield.
  - **Enhanced Yield**: Provide liquidity to earn additional returns without extra risk.

## Why FIVA?
In the ever-evolving DeFi landscape, yield can be unpredictable. FIVA leverages this volatility, offering more options to manage and maximize your yield according to your risk appetite. By creating a yield market on the TON blockchain, FIVA unlocks the full potential of DeFi, enabling greater price discovery and financial innovation.

## Vision
At FIVA, we are building the future of yield trading. By mobilizing future yield, we are shifting the management of yield from a passive to an active position. Our goal is to expand the DeFi ecosystem with novel financial products and strategies, providing users with more control, composability, and visibility.
